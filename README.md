# Personal Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this website is to house an online personal portfolio. It contains About, Work, and Contact sections which highlight who I am and what types of projects I've created. I used Bootstrap Flexbox classes to layout the page for a responsive design.

Below is an overview of my work on this application:

* Used Bootstrap's flex classes within the html elements for overall layout and responsiveness.
* Used Boostrap to create my header navigation bar, which collapses into a toggler menu in ipad/mobile view.
* When you click the nav menu items, it scrolls you down to the corresponding section.
* For the Work section, I used hyperlinked background images with overlaying text. The top project in this section takes you to the Horiseon application from Homework 1.
* Added a hover effect to my profile picture ðŸ˜Ž.
* Added hover effects to the Work and Contact elements to brighten or change color.
* Used media queries to alter various elements for a better mobile experience.
* Added meaningful comments to the HTML and CSS files for clarity.
